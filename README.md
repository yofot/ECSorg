# WARING 
I would not recommend joining any public revivals using this code, you'd be better off hosting it yourself.
# ECS
Economy Simulator is a ROBLOX revival that allows you to Relive Roblox 2016.

# CREDITS
- floatzel - creating the original economy simulator
- tenshi - old co owner of economy simulator, he probably helped with the game-server stuff.

# HOW TO RUN/BUILD/COMPILE

You will need the following dependencies:
- Windows + WSL or Linux (only for redis. rest for windows)
- PostgreSQL (Version 13+)
- Redis-Server (WSL or Linux)
- Node.js (Version 18.XX+)
- Go/GoLang (1.18+)
- .NET/dotnet (6, 7 support might be added soon.)

 # HEADS UP

 i would reconmend uninstalling anything that uses sql like xampp and stuff

 
Step 1. Create a user and database in PostgreSQL, make sure login is enabled for it. Once that's done, put a file in services/api named config.json. Put this in it (replacing the DB, User, and Pass with your credentials):
```
{
    "knex": {
	"client": "pg",
        "connection": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "user": "postgres",
        "password": "postgres",
        "database": "db_name_here"
        }
    }
}
```
You can now move on to step 2 after this.

Step 2. Go to services/api in a command prompt/terminal, then run ```npm i```. This will install the node modules needed for the next command. Now run ```npx knex migrate:latest```. If EVERYTHING was sucessful, all the migrations to the database should work. These tables are required for the site to run as otherwise, the site wouldn't know where to store the data. 

Step 3. Go to services/Roblox/Roblox.Website, and rename appsettings.example.json to appsettings.json. Put your database information there, and also change the OwnerUserId to 1, as that is the account that will be automatically created. Do NOT forget to change your paths! If you're using windows, make sure you paths are like this, with the double backslash \\ ```C:\\Users\\username\\srclocation\\services\\api\\storage\\```.

Step 4. Go into services/Roblox/Roblox.Website in a command prompt/terminal, now run ```dotnet run```. If everything is successful, you should be able to visit the site at http://localhost:5000. If not, check the errors. If services/api/public/images/thumbnails is missing, create the folder. Same for UnsecuredContent. To run in Release mode, use this command ```dotnet run -c Release```. It is worth noting that some things can break if you use Release mode before you finish all the steps here.

Step 5. Build the admin panel by going into services/admin in a command prompt/terminal, and then running ```npm i``` to install node modules, then ```npm run build```. If everything is successful, restart the dotnet terminal. You can do this super easily by pressing Ctrl + C then doing the same command again. This is make the admin panel work.

Step 6. Start the frontend by going into services/2016-roblox-main/docs/get-started.md and read the guide there. It should explain easily to you how to start up the frontend. Do not use dev mode, use ```npm run build``` && ```npm run start``` as it is MUCH faster and better.

Step 7. To finish the frontend, open services/2016-roblox-main in a terminal, then run ```npm i``` this will show the main page and fix the Network error.

Before we continue with setting up the site steps, it's time to register the first account. Go to http://localhost:5000/auth/application, now here's the tricky part.
Without editing code, the only way to get autoaccepted is to have a Roblox account that meets the requirements to get autoaccepted, which are:
- At least 1 year account age
- Either: 20K+ followers, has admin badge, 3 non free roblox made items, 1k place visits, has premium, or 2 past usernames

If you don't have a Roblox account that meets these requirements, go to services/Roblox/Roblox.Services/Users/ApplicationProcessorService.cs, and edit line 100 to be true instead of false. This will enable always autoaccept.

Once you made the application and then refreshed a second or two later, it should be accepted. Make SURE to name it ```ROBLOX``` in ALL CAPS! Not doing this can cause some issues.

Now that you've set everything up, go to the admin panel at http://localhost:5000/admin, and now set up the accounts you need to set up. 
- Go to create player, create an account with id 2, name it "UGC", then nullify its password.
- Create another account with create player with any id (I prefer id 12), with the username "BadDecisions". This is the account used to hold items that get moved automatically from GDPR deletions, and removing items from inventories. This account is **USERNAME SPECIFIC**, so make SURE it's spelt exactly right! Just copy paste mine. Once it's made, permanently ban it. (This is so some other stuff works properly).

Now we shall continue setting up the site.

Step 8. To start up the AssetValidationService, go to services/AssetValidationServiceV2 in a cmd/terminal, then run ```go run main.go```. This will start up asset validation service, and will allow you to upload items.

Step 9. RCC/Rendering setup time: Go to services/RCCService, in a command prompt, then run ```RCCService.exe -console -placeid:1818```.  If everything was correctly, RCCService should start up. Go to services/game-server, and add a file named config.json. Put this in it:
```
{
    "rcc": "rcc path here",
    "authorization": "render auth here",
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
    "rccPort": 64989,
    "port": 3040,
    "websiteBotAuth": "bot auth here",
    "thumbnailWebsocketPort": 3189,
    "dockerDisabled": true
}
```

Make sure the the authorization and websiteBotAuth are the same in appsettings.json file in services/Roblox/Roblox.Website.

Once that's done, in services/game-server, run ```npm i```, then ```npm run build```, then ```npm run start```. If everything is correctly, in a few seconds you should see "[info] new connection" in the console of game-server. Request a render, and if everything went properly, it will work.

Last thing is to edit the lua scripts in services/game-server/script change the baseurl to ```http://localhost:5000``` this will actually make the avatar renders work.


Note that you will need to configure a lot more things, Also games that you try to play will redirect to roblox. anyways these are just the basics
